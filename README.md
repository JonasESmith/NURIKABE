# NURIKABE
Applications to test all possible legal patterns for a [n,n] Nurikabe grid.

<h2> Rules </h2>
	<h4> 1. Water (black squares) must be continuous </h4>

	<h4> 2. Cannot have pools of water </h4>

# Solutions
* Brute force
  * A low level approach
  * considers all possible solutions when testing pattern
* Pruning
  * Attempts to prune bad patterns early
  * With large [n x n] prunes nearly 99% of patterns


## Solution Results

  > ( updated 10/29/19 )  - using rows that only use islands of size 1
  ## Solution Results for islands of size one

  * The idea for these results is to use rows to construct the puzzles like this for a 4x4 row `{ 0, 1, 0, 1 }` where island size cannot be greater than one.
